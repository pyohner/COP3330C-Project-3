PART ONE OF TWO
Description:
The purpose of this program - Arithmetic App - is to divide two integers, which the user is prompted to enter,
and return the result.  It will catch an ArithmeticException whenever the denominator (the second number
entered) is zero and return an exception message.

PART TWO OF TWO
Description:
The purpose of this program - Radio Station App - is to populate a list of FM radio station call signs and frequencies.
If any of the following conditions are not met, the app will throw an FMRadioStationException when the station is created:
- The call sign can only contain four capital letters and start with A, K, N, or W.
- The frequency is between 88.0 and 108.0 inclusive.
Successfully created radio stations will be printed at the end.
Some of the sample FM radio stations are purposefully meant to cause the FMRadioStationException and not be created.
